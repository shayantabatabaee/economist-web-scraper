<h2>Challenges, Difficulties and Roadmap</h2>

<li>
First of all, I examined the website's structure to gain a comprehensive understanding of its layout. Upon realizing that scraping the website using HTML tags could be time-consuming and inefficient, particularly due to potential changes over time, I opted to explore alternative approaches. My objective was to locate a suitable API that would enable me to fetch and parse the desired data. Fortunately, I discovered that The Economist provides an <a href="https://www.economist.com/rss">RSS</a> feed that I could utilize. Consequently, I focused my efforts on parsing the RSS feed to extract the latest news section, which proved to be a more reliable and efficient method.

Secondly, I selected "<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/rss.xml">The World This Week</a>" section as the source for the latest news.
